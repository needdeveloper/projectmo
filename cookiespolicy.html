                <h2>What are Cookies?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cookies are small bits of text that are downloaded to the devices you use to reach and use the Service. Your browser or device holds these cookies and makes them available every time you visit a site again so that it can recognize you and remember important information about you.
                    Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in your browser or device until you leave the site. They are then deleted from your device once you leave the Service.
                    Persistent Cookies remain in your browser or device for much longer – they remain there until you delete them or they reach their expiry date, depending on the cookie. These may, for example, be used to remember your preferences when you use the Service, recognize you on your return, and enhance your experience on the Service. Use of a persistent cookie may be linked to personal information while interacting with the Service, such as when you choose to store your user names so that you do not have to enter them each time you access your accounts. Then, a persistent cookie will be stored on your computer, which is linked to your account information. If you reject the persistent cookie, you may still use the Service but you will be limited in some areas of it.
                    <p>For more information on cookies please visit: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">All about cookies</a></p>
                </p>
                <h2>Can I Change My Cookie Preferences?</h2>
                   <p>
                    You can always change your cookie preferences or delete cookies altogether as.
                    Browser settings also allow you to choose whether or not to accept cookies or limit certain cookies. Most browsers also provide functionality that lets you review and erase cookies.
                   </p>
                <h2>Does this Policy Change?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I may change this Cookie Policy at any time. Please take a look at the date at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last updated.
                    </p>
                <h2>How I use cookies?</h2>
                <p>
                    I use cookies to make my website work better for you.
                    On www.monerowebsite.tk I use both first and third party cookies.
                    Third-party cookies are ones that are not set directly by the www.monerowebsite.tk, but they may be dropped onto your computer by a third party when you use my website.
                    As third-party cookies aren’t set by me, I can’t control how they work – but I can control which websites I choose to work with. I take your privacy seriously and I would never work with a website I don’t trust.
                </p>
                <h2>How long do cookies last?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cookies last for different lengths of time depending on what they are used for.

                    Session cookies are temporary cookies and are only stored until you leave the website or when you close your web browser.
                    Persistent cookies last for a fixed period of time, defined within the cookie, and allow the website to recognise the device again when the user returns to that website on that device.
                </p>
                <h2>Who sets the cookie?</h2>
                <p>
                    First party cookies – these are set by the website that you are visiting and can only be read by that website.
                    Third party cookies – these are set by an organisation other than the owner of the website. This might be for the purposes of website measurement, being able to watch a video on the site or for the purposes of advertising.
                </p>
                <h2>What Cookies Do I Use?</h2>
                <h3>Performance cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    These cookies are used to measure the performance of websites and see how websites are used.  I use ‘Performance’ cookies to improve how the website works and measure my marketing activity. Information that is collected using these cookies is aggregated and anonymous and I am not able to identify individual users with these cookies.
                </p>
                <h3>Functionality cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    These types of cookie allow websites to remember choices you make (for example, your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services on the site such as watching a video. These cookies do not track your browsing activity on other websites.
                </p>
                <h3>Advertising or Targeting cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.
